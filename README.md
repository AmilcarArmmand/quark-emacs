My personal emacs config.

*Featuring:*

 * Extensive version tracking backup system
 * Persistence of:
   * File locations
   * File major modes
   * Registers
   * Minibuffer histories
   * Kill ring
 * Everything that can be made fuzzy (Sublime style) has been made fuzzy, including:
   * Helm (fuzzy file finder, goto definition, etc.)
   * Company (code autocomplete)
   * Icicles (minibuffer completion)
   * Ido (minibuffer completion)
   * Isearch
 * Extremely agressive file autoloading, and fast startup times
 * An emphasis on correct code and robustness
